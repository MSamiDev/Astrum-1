## The motivation:
 
With the rapid change in climate and increasing global warming , quick response to a disaster saves a lot of lives. According to a report, climate change-induced natural disasters killed almost 3,000 people and 70,000 livestock, and destroyed around 4.1 lakh houses just this year alone. They also affected 18 lakh hectares of crop area â€” about 1% of the total cropped area in India . We studied that results can be a little worse off if we plan and manage effectively during a crisis. Hence we came up we an idea to build a Post and pre disaster management system.

## How it works :

We have a built Disaster Risk Management System for better management and collaboration during a natural or man-made disaster .Our web helps in prediction of upcoming natural threats using Nasa API, along with that we have integrated NGos , Police and local helpers on our platform for faster evacuation and relief work.

  - Astrum provides the authorities a personalized dashboard with the track of the recent evacuations and Emergency requests everything which updates synchronously. 
  - We update the recent stats no. of Injured , Deaths , Evacuated in the current disaster.
  - Finding the hospots is difficult so , we also help authorities to identify the hotspots and type of help needed there for faster rescue /operation.
  - We allow user location sharing (currently under development) to track people to rescue or in need of any kind of emergency help.
  - Using Nasa API we can track the upcoming volcanoes /tropical storms. (we expand this feature to other natural calamities) 
  - We can donate to the needy securely through our app.

<!---IDEAS--->
## Upcoming Ideas/ Improvements

We have loads of Ideas for our web app , for the time being we have thought of a few!

* Filtering about important tweets/ SOS during a calamity so that a need for help through social media doesnot go unnoticed! 
* Currently we have the free version of Google API keys which restrict many map features, we plan to improve it in future!
* Tracking more natural calamities 
* Notifications
* Improving the backend architecture of CRUD
