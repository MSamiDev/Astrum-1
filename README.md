## The motivation:
 
With the rapid change in climate and increasing global warming , quick response to a disaster saves a lot of lives. According to a report, climate change-induced natural disasters killed almost 3,000 people and 70,000 livestock, and destroyed around 4.1 lakh houses just this year alone. They also affected 18 lakh hectares of crop area â€” about 1% of the total cropped area in India . We studied that results can be a little worse off if we plan and manage effectively during a crisis. Hence we came up we an idea to build a Post and pre disaster management system.

## How it works :

We have a built Disaster Risk Management System for better management and collaboration during a natural or man-made disaster .Our web helps in prediction of upcoming natural threats using Nasa API, along with that we have integrated NGos , Police and local helpers on our platform for faster evacuation and relief work.

Astrum provides the authorities a personalized dashboard with the track of the recent evacuations and Emergency requests everything in a dashboard works in a synchronous mannner. We also provide them the recent stats of the current disaster ongoing Injured , Deaths , Evacuated. As in the disaster finding the hospots is difficult so , we also help authorities to identify the hotspots and type of help needed there with accurate postion on google map , so that help can be provided them as soon as possible.
